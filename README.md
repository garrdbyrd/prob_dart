# prob_dart
A library of probability distributions for the Dart language.

current release: 0.1.0

## About
The goal for this project is to develop an in-depth libary that provides selections of continuous and discrete probability distributions. Each distribution class will provide methods such as return random variable, probability distribution function, cumulative distribution function, median, mean, variance, higher moments, percent point functions, etc.

Currently this project is to be modelled after [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html).
